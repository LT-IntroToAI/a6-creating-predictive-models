In this assignment, you will create predictive models with linear regression, logistic regressions, classifications, and clustering.  There is starter code and examples in each folder.  All assignments to be completed start with `a6_part?.py`.  I will be grading those parts plus the writeup for each part.

There are a lot of parts on this assignment.  They are intended to be completed in order and will build on each other.  Every part includes examples of how to complete the problem and then you will create your models on different datasets.
